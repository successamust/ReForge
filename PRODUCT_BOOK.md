# ReForge: The Operator's Field Manual

> **"Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking. But to build new civilizations, we must first learn to think again."**

## 01. The Manifesto: Why You Are Here

You are here because you have become dependent. 

Modern development has become a game of assembly, not creation. Developers glue together libraries they don't understand, relying on AI to write the glue. When the AI fails, the "engineer" is helpless.

**ReForge is not a bootcamp.** It is a rehabilitation center for your technical autonomy. We strip away the autocomplete, the copilots, and the abstractions to force you to confront the raw logic underneath.

### The Core Pillars
1.  **The Muscle (Logic & Fundamentals):** Rebuilding the neural pathways for pointers, recursions, and memory management.
2.  **The Metal (Manual Translation):** Bridging the gap between a mental model and binary execution without intermediate AI assistance.
3.  **The Momentum (30-Day Sequence):** A progressive "detox" that scales from simple syntax to complex architectural patterns.

## 02. The Protocol: How It Works

ReForge operates on a simple, brutal cycle designed to rewire your coding intuition.

### The Constraints
- **The Anti-Paste Barrier:** The ReForge IDE actively blocks all pasting operations. If it's in the editor, you typed it.
- **The Black Box (Anti-Cheat):** High-resolution telemetry capturing keystroke dynamics and timing variance to verify manual execution.
- **The "No-Copilot" Sandbox:** A distraction-free environment where your only external resource is documentation and your own logic.
- **The Relapse Protocol:** Missing a 24-hour mission window triggers a Relapse State, locking the dashboard until a Detox Protocol is completed.
- **The Global Mission Timer:** A persistent countdown to the 24-hour reset is integrated into the operational header, ensuring the 24-hour "Mission Window" is always a priority.
- **The Rollback Punishment:** Failure to complete a daily challenge within the window resets your progress for that module. Consistency is non-negotiable.

## 03. The Architecture: Under the Hood

ReForge is engineered for precision and security.

### 1. Sandboxed Execution Engine
Every submission is isolated in an ephemeral Docker container. We don't just run your code; we stress-test it against:
- **Edge cases** that AI often misses.
- **Strict memory limits** to ensure efficient allocation.
- **Execution timeouts** to catch inefficient O(n^2) logic.

### 2. The Progression Engine
A stateful tracking system that manages:
- **Logic Flow Density:** Measuring the ratio of attempts to successes, visualized via the **Success Density Heatmap**.
- **Keyboard Velocity:** Tracking raw input speed versus logical pauses.
- **Real-Time Achievement Propagation:** Awarding milestones like "Pointer Master" instantly via the **Achievement Toast** system.
- **High-Fidelity Validation:** Capturing precise **Expected vs Actual** logical diffs during reconstruction attempts.

## 04. The Cockpit: Interface Mechanics

### The Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
Your primary workspace is a distraction-free, terminal-styled environment.
*   **The Editor:** A raw text input designed for focus. Syntax highlighting is minimal to force you to read the code, not the colors.
*   **The Output Console:** Provides raw stdout/stderr feedback. Learn to love the error messages; they are your only teachers.

### The Rehab Dashboard
Tracks your recovery metrics in real-time.
*   **Success Density (Heatmap):** A global indicator of first-pass logic difficulty for every challenge.
*   **Accuracy:** The percentage of first-pass logic success.
*   **Logic Velocity:** A calculated metric of how quickly you translate requirements into working code.
*   **Detox Streak:** Your consecutive days of manual mastery.

### Operational Navigation
*   **Protocol Dropdown:** A streamlined, distraction-free gateway to curriculum, practice, and analytics areas.

## 05. The Hierarchy: Ranks & Achievements

ReForge tracks every neural reconnection. Your prestige is a direct reflection of your manual autonomy.

### 1. Language Milestones
Every language track has specific thresholds of reconstruction:
- **Initiate:** Day 01 completion.
- **Operator:** Day 07 completion.
- **Architect:** Day 15 completion.
- **Reclaimer:** Day 30 completion.

### 2. Performance Commendations
Awarded for exceptional execution:
- **First Blood:** Your first successful reconstruction.
- **Sharpshooter:** Successful completion on the first attempt.
- **Speed Demon:** Completion in under 300 seconds (5 minutes).
- **Polyglot:** Activating 3 or more language protocols.
- **The Reforged:** Completing the 30-day detox across all 5 languages.

### 3. Global Ranking Tiers
Your position on the **Elite Table** is determined by your total reconstruction points:
- **Champion (Rank 1):** The current global pinnacle of manual logic.
- **Elite (Rank 2-3):** Demonstrating near-perfect consistency.
- **Master (Rank 4-10):** Highly capable operators with deep fundamental understanding.
- **Verified (Rank 11-25):** Proven consistency in complex scenarios.
- **Rising (Rank 26-50):** Showing rapid neural adaptation.
- **Active (Rank 51+):** Operational and in-rehab.

## 06. The Roadmap: Future Protocols

The ReForge vision extends beyond the 30-day detox.

### Q1 2026: Advanced Curriculum
- **Systems Track:** Implementing TCP/IP stacks and file systems from scratch.
- **Compilers Track:** Building a lexer and parser for a subset of C.

### Q2 2026: The Arena
- **Real-time Peer Reconstruction:** Face-to-face algorithmic battles with zero assistance.
- **The Global Leaderboard:** Ranking the world's most disciplined manual operators.

## 06. Tips for Survival

### Read the Error Logs
In modern dev, we often just copy the error into ChatGPT. Here, you must read the stack trace. The answer is always in the logs.

### Diagram First, Code Second
Without an AI to iterate for you, you must plan your logic before you type. Use a pen and paper. Sketch the state changes.

### Embrace the "Stuck"
Being stuck is the sensation of learning. When you hit a wall, do not look for a bypass. Push through it. The mental effort *is* the value.
