# ReForge

**Rebuild Your Muscle. Regain Your Control.**

ReForge is a developer rehabilitation platform designed to help engineers break free from AI reliance and rebuild their manual coding intuition. Through a 30-day "detox" program, users solve algorithmic challenges across multiple languages (JavaScript, Python, Java, Go, C#) with strict constraints—no pasting, no AI assistants, just you and the code.

## Project Structure

This repository is divided into two main components:

- **[Frontend Documentation](./Frontend/README.md)**: The React-based user interface, featuring a custom IDE, dashboard visualization, and an immersive "hacker" aesthetic.
- **[Backend Documentation](./Backend/README.md)**: The Node.js/Express API that handles code execution (via Docker), progression logic, user management, and security.

## Getting Started

To run the full stack locally:

1.  **Backend**: Navigate to the `Backend` directory and follow the setup instructions to start the API and database.
2.  **Frontend**: Navigate to the `Frontend` directory and start the Vite development server.

Refer to the respective READMEs for detailed installation and environment configuration steps.
